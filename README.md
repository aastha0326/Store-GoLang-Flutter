# Store-GoLang-Flutter
Implemented a Golang API server which caters to HTTP GET request from client.
Hi, this is Sakshi
I have created a hypothetical store with products carrying attributes: Name, Price and Count. A valid HTTP GET request gets a response with list of products.
It is basically a Flutter App that will execute API calls to server. The fetched data in JSON format from server will be displayed in List.
